# Haskell-Threads: Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks detailing implementations and experiments in machine learning, specifically focusing on classification and neural networks. The projects simulate various scenarios and utilize different datasets to demonstrate the application of these techniques in solving real-world problems.

### Projects Included:
- **wk4_Classification_I_Sai_Vivek_Rambha_2023585403_Assignment_1_part_2a.ipynb**: Explores classification algorithms and their application.
- **wk6_NN_Sai_Vivek_Rambha_2023585403_Assignment_1_part_2b.ipynb**: Focuses on neural networks, including an exploration of the XOR problem and an MLP classifier for the Iris dataset.
